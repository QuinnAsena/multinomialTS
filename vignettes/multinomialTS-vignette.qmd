# Introduction

One of the primary goals of this model is to be able to test multiple hypotheses about the data and lend statistical support to the different hypotheses. For example which environmental drivers are having the strongst effects on which taxa? Or, are interactions among taxa or abiotic variables driving change in the system? This state-space approach allows us to estimate coefficients for taxa interactions and driver-taxa relationships, that we don't get from methods such as ordination or cluster analysis. We recommend this method as complimentary to other methods, as both have their advantages.

## This vignette

This vignette will take us through:

- Choosing a binning resolution for `mnTS()`
- Finding initial conditions with `mnGLMM()`
- Fitting `mnTS()` with and without species interactions
- assess the resulting models

# Fitting `mnTS()`

This vignette will work with the data that have focal taxa and groups already wrangled. A second vignette will be added to cover the data wrangling, for now see ![this workshop](https://quinnasena.github.io/state-space-workhop-ESA/state-space-walkthrough.html)
